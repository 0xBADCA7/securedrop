<h1>Your ID</h1>

<p>Your secure identifier is:</p>

<h2>$iid</h2>

<p>You will need this identifier to access any responses to your submission. Please save it in a secure place if you want to be able to get responses. (However, this identifier of course will help identify you as the submitter -- so don't keep it anywhere it might get discovered.)</p>

<form method="post" action="/lookup/">
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="$iid" />
<p>Once you've taken care of that: <button type="submit">Continue...</button></p>
