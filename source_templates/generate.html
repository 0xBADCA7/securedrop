$def with (iid)
<h1>Your code name</h1>

<p>To keep you anonymous, we're assigning you a code name. Your code name is:</p>

<h2>$iid</h2>

<p>You will need this code name to access any responses to your submission. Please memorize it or save it in a secure place if you want to be able to get responses. (However, this code name of course will help identify you as the submitter -- so don't keep it anywhere it might get discovered.)</p>

<form method="post" action="/lookup/">
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="$iid" />
<p>Once you've taken care of that: <button type="submit">Continue...</button></p>
</form>
